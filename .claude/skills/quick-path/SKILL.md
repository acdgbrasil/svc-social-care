  Fast-path for trivial tasks that don't need the full pipeline.
  Use for bugfixes, small refactors, single-file changes, documentation, or config tweaks.
  Bypasses architect/test-writer/review-loops.

# Quick Path — Fast Track for Trivial Tasks

## Decision Rule

Use quick-path if ALL of these are true:
- Touches <= 3 files
- Stays within 1 layer (Domain OR Application OR IO)
- Does NOT touch auth/session/middleware/security
- Does NOT change public API contracts
- Is a bugfix, small refactor, config change, or doc update

If ANY of these is true, use full pipeline instead:
- Touches 3+ files across 2+ layers
- Touches auth, JWT, middleware, or security
- Changes aggregate structure or domain events
- Adds new endpoint or use case
- Needs design discussion

## Execution Flow

1. **Classify** — is this really trivial? Check the decision rule above.
2. **Discuss** (optional, `--discuss`) — quick alignment with user
3. **Implement** — make the change
4. **Test** (optional, `--test`) — run `swift test --filter RelevantTest`
5. **Verify** — `swift build` must pass
6. **Review** (optional, `--review`) — quick code-reviewer pass
7. **Report** — summary of what changed

## Flags
- `--discuss` — ask clarifying questions before implementing
- `--test` — write/run tests for the change
- `--review` — run code-reviewer agent on the changed files
- `--security` — run secure-code-reviewer on the changed files
